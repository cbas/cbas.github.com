## Repeat after me: Gamification Is Not About Games.

It's about game theory, a field of mathematics, you know, like that [Beautiful Mind](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/) movie.

*Gamification means creating a meticulously balanced structure of incentives and disincentives to coax users to behave in a desired manner.*

## It's about incentives.

When designing a product of feature, before doing any coding, think hard about the incentives that will drive its users.

- Does paying for a product bring *happiness* to a user?
- Will the user *feel safer* by using your service?
- Does it help a user *gain social status* with her peers?
- How will a customer *increase her material wealth* through this product?
- Etc.

## And enough with the badges already.

The field of gamification is a twist on marketing and product design through applied psychology.

The typical achievement badges, experience points, or leader boards are merely proxies of social status, a weak incentive. Especially when that social status only exists within the tiny community of an app's users, a mere sliver of the user's total social life.

Psychologists have a ranking for incentives called the [Maslow hierarchy](http://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html). There are strong incentives like survival, sex, happiness, food, money. Think about how to work these into your app instead of focusing on badges and points.
