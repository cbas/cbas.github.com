Lately I've been working with a small team on a single page app for a startup. Automated testing has been a key enabler for our collaboration. For instance on the first day one developer joined, he was able to be immediately productive: refactoring 140+ files, deploying the changes to production, all without fear of breaking the build.

This talk I presented at [Singapore.JS](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/) recaps some of my experience with frontend testing. The demo code, using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) with [JSHint](http://jshint.com/), [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit), and [CasperJS](casperjs.org), is available at: [https://github.com/cbas/demo-testing](https://github.com/cbas/demo-testing)
